## **Spring Boot Challenge Lab: Implementing a Microservice with HATEOAS & Actuators**

### **Objective:**
Envision a real-world use case and implement it as a microservice using Spring Boot, emphasizing the principles of HATEOAS and the benefits of actuators.

### **Prerequisites:**
- JDK 17
- Gradle
- An IDE or text editor

---

### **Challenge Steps:**

1. **Envision Your Use Case:**
    - Think about a daily task or a common process that could benefit from being digitized.
    - Examples: Booking a hotel room, ordering food, scheduling a meeting, etc.
    - Document the primary entities involved and their relationships.

2. **Setting Up the Environment:**

    - Install JDK 17 and Gradle.
    - Refer to [Spring's guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/) for Gradle basics if needed.

3. **Bootstrap Your Spring Boot Application:**

    Use the [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a Gradle project with `Web`, `JPA`, `HATEOAS`, and `Actuator` dependencies. Download and unzip the project.

4. **Design Your Domain Model:**

    Based on the use case you envisioned, define the domain model. If you considered a hotel booking system, perhaps start with an `Hotel` or `Reservation` entity.

5. **Repository & Database Setup:**

    Create a repository for your primary entity. You might want to refer to the [Spring Data JPA guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/).

6. **Implement HATEOAS:**

    Modify your REST controller to integrate HATEOAS principles. Make sure entities have links to related resources. For guidance, check the [Spring HATEOAS guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-hateoas/).

7. **Actuator Integration:**

    Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features for your application. Integrate actuators and explore the various endpoints like `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/info`. More about this can be found in the [Spring Boot Actuator guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/).

8. **Implement GET & POST Requests:**

    - For the `GET` request, retrieve details of your primary entity (like getting details of a specific hotel room).
    - For the `POST` request, allow creating a new instance of your primary entity (like booking a hotel room).

9. **Test Your Microservice:**

    Start your application and use tools like `curl` or Postman to test your endpoints. Ensure that HATEOAS links guide you through the application and that actuators provide valuable insights.

10. **Reflection:**

    Think about the following:
    - How does HATEOAS improve the discoverability of your API?
    - In what scenarios are actuators most beneficial?

---

### **Conclusion:**

By the end of this lab, you should have a functional microservice representing your envisioned use case, with HATEOAS links guiding its consumers and actuators providing production-ready features.
